# Serverless Golang

A list of serverless resources, tools, and frameworks specifically for Golang. Please feel free to fork and send pull requests to include additional links (trying to keep things alphabetically ordered). This list is, in some ways, a subset of https://github.com/ServerlessHeroes/serverless-resources and inspired by some of the other lists out there like https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go and is intended to work the same way (both of those lists you should also check out by the way).
