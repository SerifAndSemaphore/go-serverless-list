# Serverless Golang

A list of serverless resources, tools, and frameworks specifically for Golang. Please feel free to fork and send pull requests to include additional links (trying to keep things alphabetically ordered). This list is, in some ways, a subset of https://github.com/ServerlessHeroes/serverless-resources and inspired by some of the other lists out there like https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go and is intended to work the same way (both of those lists you should also check out by the way).

# Platforms & Services
_Serverless platforms and services that support Go (where you can run your functions)_

[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda) - AWS Lambda will allow Go through a wrapper (see tools below)

[Hyper.sh](https://console.hyper.sh/register/invite/4DWLbzRrPYumMW47jyLACr6zwqRNJNcO) - Hyper.sh allows you to run Docker containers billed by the second and is a fully managed PaaS...and those are the reasons why it's roped in with "serverless" (shameless full disclosure: my referral code in URL)

[Iron Functions](https://github.com/iron-io/functions) - Iron.io has open sourced it's Functions platform which lets you run Docker container to run functions

[Microsoft Azure Functions]() - Azure Functions will allow Go through a wrapper similar to AWS Lambda

[OpenFaaS - Functions as a Service](https://github.com/openfaas/faas) - Serverless platform/framework for Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Hyper.sh, DC/OS and Rancher

## Frameworks

[discfg](https://github.com/tmaiaroto/discfg) - A serverless application configuration tool using Lambda and DynamoDB

## Stand Alone Deployment Tools
_Tools that aren't quite frameworks, but are intended for getting your Go code easily deployed to a serverless provider._

[Aegis](https://github.com/tmaiaroto/aegis) - A tool for deploying AWS Lambda Proxy with API Gateway (allows your Lambda to handle any RESTful requests via API Gateway's `ANY` method)
